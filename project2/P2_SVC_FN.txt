I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.
You can't beat the price on these.
The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  
Omelets are to die for!
Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.
Totally believable.  
Pretty cool I would say.
good protection and does not make phone too bulky.
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  
Definitely worth checking out.  
This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.
GO AND SEE IT!  
WORTHWHILE.
You wont regret it!  
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!
Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.
I had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product.
Will order from them again!
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  
This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.
But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.
Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!
The aerial scenes were well-done.  
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.
Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!
I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.
It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.
It is worth the drive.
Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.
I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.
I would recommend it.
)Setup couldn't have been simpler.
Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  
Brilliance indeed.  
Its a total package.
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  
Made very sturdy.
Barney is definitely super DE duper.  
I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.
You won't be disappointed.
The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.
10/10  
This case seems well made.
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  
Also makes it easier to hold on to.
You wont regret it!  
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  
It is an insane game.  
No complaints!
Best tater tots in the southwest.
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!
The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.
It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.
jabra ear gels "R" the best!.
I was seated immediately.
But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  
The shipping time was also very quick!
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!
Predictable, but not a bad watch.  
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.
For that, it's worth checking out.  
This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems
We'd definitely go back here again.
Brilliance indeed.  
Pretty cool I would say.
Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.
This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.

The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.
I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  
But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  
It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  
It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  
My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.
This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.
Brilliance indeed.  
Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.
Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  
Best tater tots in the southwest.
Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  
But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  
Check it out.
I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.
I own 2 of these cases and would order another.
Happy so far!.
Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.
I gave it a 10  
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.
Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.
Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.
An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  
I can't wait to go back.
Linked to my phone without effort.
I would recommend it.
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!
It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.
Very prompt service.
I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  
Worth every penny.
I have recommended it to friends.  
It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  
Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.
Go rent it.  
I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!
Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  
I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.
.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.
I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.
If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  
It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  
Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.
!I definitly recommend!!
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  
The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  
Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  
But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.
Protects the phone on all sides.
Ample portions and good prices.
If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  
I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had.
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.
Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended
Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  
Meredith M was better than all right.  
Babie Bop is very cute.  
Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale.  
It's worth driving up from Tucson!
It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!
jabra ear gels "R" the best!.
It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.
Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!
If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  
It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the "gadget".  
I would recommend this.
I hope this place sticks around.
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.
It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  
Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  
:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.
***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!
The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.
I would recommend this.
It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.
The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  
It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  
But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.
My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.
I had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product.
This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.
The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  
I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.
For that, it's worth checking out.  
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.
Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!
Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  
good protection and does not make phone too bulky.
:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.
Go rent it.  
Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.
Meredith M was better than all right.  
Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.
I was very excited to get this headset because I thought it was really cute.
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  
I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was "The Stranger" and I loved it.  
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.
Excellent wallet type phone case.
Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.
These were so good we ordered them twice.
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  
After one bite, I was hooked.
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  
My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!
For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.
IT'S REALLY EASY.
Linked to my phone without effort.
Better than you'd expect.
Don't miss it.  
Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.
Never had anything to complain about here.
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.
In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim "Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?
Meredith M was better than all right.  
Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.
It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.
The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  
Made very sturdy.
No complaints!
These were so good we ordered them twice.
Jawbone Era is awesome too!
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.
Barney is definitely super DE duper.  
An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.
10/10  
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  
It has kept up very well.
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.
i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.
Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  
Raw and sublimely moving.  
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.
Timely shipment and quality product.
Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.
This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems
:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.
It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.
This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.
Better than you'd expect.
Totally believable.  
It worked very well.
Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  
This case seems well made.

Totally believable.  
Predictable, but not a bad watch.  
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.
I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!
Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  
Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  
Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however.  
It definitely was not as good as my S11.
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.
You can't beat the price on these.
It was awesome.
He's a national treasure.  
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.
I highly recommend this case.
I rate this movie 9/10.  
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.
You won't be disappointed.
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .
Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!
I've dropped my phone more times than I can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!).
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.
I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.
10/10  
I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  
Highly recommended.
It has kept up very well.
I advise you to look out for it.  
An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  
You won't be disappointed.
!I definitly recommend!!
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  
It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.
WELL IM SATISFIED.
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  
I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.
Would recommend this item.
Would recommend this item.
Raw and sublimely moving.  
It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.
Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  
The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  
But "Tiny Toons" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  
Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.
Babie Bop is very cute.  
Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.
Definitely worth checking out.  
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  
It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.
awesome device.
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  
I can't wait to go back.
The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  
It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!
You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."
The phone loads super!
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.
And those baby owls were adorable.  
Really pleased with this product so far.
These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.
You won't regret it!
This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.
2 thumbs up to this seller
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.
I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure.
Will be back again!
Omelets are to die for!
I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.
I would highly recommend this.
I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging.
Its a total package.
Jawbone Era is awesome too!
Worth every penny.
But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  
Someone shouldve invented this sooner.
I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had.
I own 2 of these cases and would order another.

Razr Battery - Good buy.
The "1.2" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7.
Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.
I'm still infatuated with this phone.
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.
It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  
You won't be disappointed.

Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.
Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.
I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!
awesome device.
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  
It's fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable.
I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  
The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.
Definitely worth checking out.  
I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!
It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.
But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.
I rate this movie 9/10.  
Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.
Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.
Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick".  
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.

I was seated immediately.
Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  
We'd definitely go back here again.

Service was very prompt.
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).

Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.
Very wind-resistant.
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.
Iam very pleased with my purchase.
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.
Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.

The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.
I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.

A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  
It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.

As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.

It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.
