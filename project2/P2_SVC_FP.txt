This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.
That was done in the second movie.  
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.
Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.
Highly unrecommended.  
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  
Not easy to watch.  
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
Excellent starter wireless headset.
The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.
Tasted like dirt.
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.
I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  
- They never brought a salad we asked for.
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  
If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  
poor quality and service.
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
All in all, a great disappointment.  
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  
Highly unrecommended.  
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  
Not good enough for the price.
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.
poor quality and service.
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  
This place lacked style!!
Buy a different phone - but not this.
The character developments also lacked in depth.  
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.
Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  
A truly, truly bad film.  
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  
DELETE this film from your mind!  
Must have been an off night at this place.
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
But it's just not funny.  
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.
However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.
The ear buds only play music in one ear.
Very Dissapointing Performance.
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  
But it's just not funny.  
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  
Audio Quality is poor, very poor.
The movie seemed a little slow at first.  
But it's just not funny.  
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.
It was forced, like everything in this movie.  
Must have been an off night at this place.
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.
The service here is fair at best.
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.
No real improvement.
The design is very odd, as the ear "clip" is not very comfortable at all.
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  
- They never brought a salad we asked for.
I never walked out of a movie faster.  
Does not fit.
Poor quality.
It is not good.  
Nothing new there.  
Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  
It was forced, like everything in this movie.  
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  
Then the film just dropped the ball.  
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!
Does not fit.
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".  
Not easy to watch.  
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.
The poor actors.  
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  
Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  
The poor actors.  
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  
It was way over fried.
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  
20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  
The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.
However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.
None of them are engaging or exciting.  
I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  
I would have given no star if I was able.

The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.
Must have been an off night at this place.
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.
The fried rice was dry as well.
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  
Very Dissapointing Performance.
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  
This place deserves no stars.
I was not impressed by this product.
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...
The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.

Not good for the money.
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.
Does not fit.
I found this product to be waaay too big.
You can find better movies at youtube.  
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  
There is nothing authentic about this place.
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.

I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".  
It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.
Cant get the software to work with my computer.

very tough and very short on flavor!

I have had this phone for over a year now, and I will tell you, its not that great.
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  
The poor actors.  
I cannot make calls at certain places.
If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  
The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.
Mediocre food.
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  
Soggy and not good.

We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.
For service, I give them no stars.
The design is very odd, as the ear "clip" is not very comfortable at all.
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  
Now this is a movie I really dislike.  
Not worth it.
Reception is terrible and full of static.
Nothing new there.  
Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  
The concert sequences just sucked.  
The script iswas there a script?  
It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
I was not impressed by this product.
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.
did not like at all.

This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.
Not good enough for the price.
How can that be?The audio quality is poor.
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  
The service was a bit lacking.
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  
The selection of food was not the best.

In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.
It was way over fried.
The script iswas there a script?  
Also the story and acting were weak.  
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.

The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
Very poor service.
I was not happy with this item.
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.
bad fit, way too big.
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  
Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.
Cant get the software to work with my computer.
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.
The turkey and roast beef were bland.
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  
None of them are engaging or exciting.  
Why was this film made?  
How can that be?The audio quality is poor.
Very Dissapointing Performance.
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.

Truly awful.
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.
I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.
Soggy and not good.
Nothing special.
Not impressed.
I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  
the presentation of the food was awful.
Very little music or anything to speak of.  
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.
Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.

The film looks cheap and bland.  
Unless you're just out to visually "collect" all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.  
Highly unrecommended.  
Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  
did not like at all.
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
first time there and might just be the last.

After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
The descriptions said "yum yum sauce" and another said "eel sauce", yet another said "spicy mayo"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!

Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  
Not worth it.
Buttons are too small.
I was very disappointed in the movie.  
You can find better movies at youtube.  
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.
Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  
Everything about this movie is stupid.  
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  
The lead man is charisma-free.  
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!
Lame would be the best way to describe it.  
The service was a bit lacking.

Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.

Crostini that came with the salad was stale.

This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  
I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.
camera color balance is AWFUL.
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".  
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.
The ear buds only play music in one ear.
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".

The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  
I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  
Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  
Not impressed.
It was not good.
Not good for the money.
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
The directing is sloppy at best.  
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.

Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.

Weird vibe from owners.
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.

There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
The visual effects were AWFUL.
