I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.
The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.
Totally believable.  
I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.
The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  
It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.

We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.
I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I'm glad I did.
Their steaks are 100% recommended!
Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  
I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.
While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  
I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.
To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.
I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.
You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.
the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.
I'll definitely be in soon again.
As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  
very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.
It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.
Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
Definitely worth checking out.  
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  
Very wind-resistant.
Meredith M was better than all right.  
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.
Omelets are to die for!
I own 2 of these cases and would order another.
I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.
I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had.
Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.
Check it out.
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.
***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.
I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.
It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  
Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  
I can't wait to go back.
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.
I would recommend this.
much better than the hard plastic cases.
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.
Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.
The phone is sturdy and waterproof.
The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.
Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  
This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.
After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.
Definitely worth checking out.  
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.
As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.

Linked to my phone without effort.
The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  
It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  
But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!
The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.
And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.
I don't think you will be disappointed.  
Iam very pleased with my purchase.
I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.
You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  
:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.
Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  
This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.
10/10  
Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick".  
Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.
This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  
I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  
Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  
You won't regret it!
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  
The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  
Someone shouldve invented this sooner.
Will be back again!
It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the "gadget".  
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.
Protects the phone on all sides.
After one bite, I was hooked.
The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  
Service was very prompt.
The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.
These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.
In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  
This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.
But "Tiny Toons" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  
The phone is sturdy and waterproof.
Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  
Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  
!I definitly recommend!!
It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.
Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).
Plan on ordering from them again and again.
The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.
To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.

This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.
I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.

:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  
Setup went very smoothly.
The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  
Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.
I will never forget it now.  
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.
The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  
I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.
This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.
They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.
:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.
This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.
Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.
You won't be disappointed.
It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days.

Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  
What I really like there is the crepe station.
Setup went very smoothly.
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.
No complaints!
I was seated immediately.
Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  
Never had anything to complain about here.
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.
Definitely worth checking out.  
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.
So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
Plan on ordering from them again and again.
In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim "Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?
Jawbone Era is awesome too!
Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far.
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.
;) Recommend with confidence!  
I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.
Razr Battery - Good buy.
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.
It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.

Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!
Their chow mein is so good!
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.
10/10  
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.
I'm using it with an iriver SPINN (with case) and it fits fine.
If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  
10/10  
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.
Excellent wallet type phone case.
Omelets are to die for!
It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.
I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.
An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.
But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  
Check it out.
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.
Plan on ordering from them again and again.
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.

It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  
I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.
It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  
* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!

Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.
Better than you'd expect.
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.
I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.
Setup went very smoothly.
Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  
I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  
This case seems well made.
It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.
I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.

Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.
I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.
Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  
No complaints!
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.

I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.
Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.
Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended
In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.

This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.
The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  
I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.
Totally believable.  
Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  
Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.
It definitely was not as good as my S11.
This game rocks.  
Definitely a bargain.
I would recommend it.
We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.

It is an insane game.  
Food was so gooodd.
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).
Very wind-resistant.
Omelets are to die for!
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).
