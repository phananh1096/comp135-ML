Excellent starter wireless headset.
The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  
Not easy to watch.  
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
