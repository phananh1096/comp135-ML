Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.
Spend your money and time some place else.
This place lacked style!!
Again, no plot at all.  
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.
stay away from this store, be careful.
Lame would be the best way to describe it.  
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  
Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  
Won't go back.
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.
did not like at all.
did not like at all.
Not good enough for the price.
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.
Food was below average.
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.
The kids play area is NASTY!
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  
Avoid this film at all costs.  
very tough and very short on flavor!
The least said about the acting the better.  
I found this product to be waaay too big.
Everything about this product is wrong.First
I found this product to be waaay too big.
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.
Lots of holes in the script.  
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  
Unfortunately it did not work.
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  
You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  
I want my money back.
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  
The battery life is highly unacceptable.
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.
Not easy to watch.  
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  
Having trouble with volume.
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  
Won't go back.
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.
The live music on Fridays totally blows.
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  
Lame would be the best way to describe it.  
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.
I'm super pissd.
Disappointing experience.
A bit predictable.  
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  
I had to purchase a different case.
Spend your money elsewhere.
It was forced, like everything in this movie.  
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.
All in all, a great disappointment.  
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  
The directing is sloppy at best.  
The battery life is highly unacceptable.
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  
Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  
Lots of holes in the script.  
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".  
This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
Must have been an off night at this place.
This place deserves no stars.
I probably won't be coming back here.
Very little music or anything to speak of.  
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.
The fried rice was dry as well.
Not recommended.  
Nothing new there.  
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.
The lead man is charisma-free.  
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  
The fried rice was dry as well.
Very poor service.
Weird vibe from owners.
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
- They never brought a salad we asked for.
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.
poor quality and service.
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.
My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.
I was not happy with this item.
Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  
Poor Construction.
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.
I was very disappointed in the movie.  
bad fit, way too big.
The battery life is highly unacceptable.
Piece of Junk.
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  
There is nothing authentic about this place.
The kids play area is NASTY!
DELETE this film from your mind!  
Not worth it.
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  
Also the story and acting were weak.  
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  
The turkey and roast beef were bland.
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
Excellent starter wireless headset.
I'm not eating here!
not even a "hello, we will be right with you."
All in all, a great disappointment.  
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  
Reception is terrible and full of static.
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  
Then the film just dropped the ball.  
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.
Over rated.
Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.
Must have been an off night at this place.
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.
Tasted like dirt.
It was forced, like everything in this movie.  
Pretty piece of junk.
stay away from this store, be careful.
If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.
The service was not up to par, either.
The soundtrack sucked.  
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
poor quality and service.
Not good for the money.
Battery has no life.
Avoid this film at all costs.  
Battery has no life.
I was very disappointed in the movie.  
Cumbersome design.
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
Very Dissapointing Performance.
It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  
Item Does Not Match Picture.
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  
Design Flaw?.
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.
Won't go back.
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.
Tasted like dirt.
The lighting is awful.  
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  
stay away from this store, be careful.
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  
Very Dissapointing Performance.
Avoid this film at all costs.  
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  
I'm returning them.
I'm not eating here!
I hate movies like that.  
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  
Unfortunately it did not work.
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.
Mediocre food.
Why was this film made?  
The item received was Counterfeit.
It was packed!!
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.
The service was a bit lacking.
No real improvement.
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.
We will not be coming back.
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  
A bit predictable.  
Not recommended.  
Buttons are too small.
DELETE this film from your mind!  
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.
Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  
The battery life is highly unacceptable.
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  
did not like at all.
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  
Lots of holes in the script.  
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.
Poor quality.
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.
The service was terrible, food was mediocre.
I think not again
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.
They work about 2 weeks then break.
Not easy to watch.  
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  
Poor product.
stay away from this store, be careful.
The story line is totally predictable.  
stay away from this store, be careful.
Not impressed.
But I definitely would not eat here again.
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.
Poor product.
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  
poor voice clarity.
I would not recommend this place.
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.
Bad Reception.
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  
Not good enough for the price.
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  
Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  
I think not again
The fried rice was dry as well.
I probably would not go here again.

This may be the only bad film he ever made.  
It was not good.
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.
The film looks cheap and bland.  
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.
Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.
After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
The film looks cheap and bland.  
The kids play area is NASTY!
Now this is a movie I really dislike.  
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.

The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.
I had to purchase a different case.
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.

Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.
Which are small and not worth the price.
I will not return.
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  
Lots of holes in the script.  
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  
Not good enough for the price.

It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.
I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  
Buttons are too small.
I cannot make calls at certain places.
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.

It was not good.
Unless you're just out to visually "collect" all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.  
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.
We will not be coming back.
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
Everything about this product is wrong.First
Truly awful.
After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.
Nothing special.
The soundtrack sucked.  
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.

Why was this film made?  
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.
The directing is sloppy at best.  
It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.
I was not happy with this item.
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
Audio Quality is poor, very poor.
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
But then they came back cold.
camera color balance is AWFUL.
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.
None of them are engaging or exciting.  
Poor quality.
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.
Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  
Nothing new there.  
Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.
Does not fit.
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.
Design Flaw?.
The turkey and roast beef were bland.
Spend your money and time some place else.
Everything about this movie is stupid.  
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.
About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".  
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.
Why was this film made?  
there is no real plot.  
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  
The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  
It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  
I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  
I never walked out of a movie faster.  
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  
The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  
We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.

Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.

This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  
Low Quality.
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.
That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.
) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.

There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.

Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  
The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.
The movie seemed a little slow at first.  
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  
Very little music or anything to speak of.  
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  
20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  
I'm not eating here!
Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.
Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  
If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  
Low Quality.
I never walked out of a movie faster.  
Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  
That was done in the second movie.  
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.

2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !
Bad Reception.
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  
It was not good.
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.
The lead man is charisma-free.  
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  
I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  
A truly, truly bad film.  
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!
The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).
The selection of food was not the best.
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  
However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.
Bad Reception.
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!
If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.
the presentation of the food was awful.
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  
This place deserves no stars.
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  
It is not good.  
There is nothing authentic about this place.
the presentation of the food was awful.
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.
The live music on Fridays totally blows.
It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).
It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.
Just does not work.
It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.
But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost.
For service, I give them no stars.
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  
I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  
You can find better movies at youtube.  
Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  
The movie seemed a little slow at first.  
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  
I have had this phone for over a year now, and I will tell you, its not that great.
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  
This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  
Not good enough for the price.
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  
But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost.
I would have given no star if I was able.
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
For a product that costs as much as this one does, I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does.
It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  
The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
I probably won't be back, to be honest.
The live music on Fridays totally blows.
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.
There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.
The ear buds only play music in one ear.
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  
If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.
It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  
But it's just not funny.  
The fried rice was dry as well.
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.
Not good for the money.
The turkey and roast beef were bland.
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!

I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.
Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.
Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie "Grim", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  
After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.
Just does not work.
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  
It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.
It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.
I never walked out of a movie faster.  
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.

the presentation of the food was awful.
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.

About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.
It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.
The design is very odd, as the ear "clip" is not very comfortable at all.
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  
The lead man is charisma-free.  
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.
You can find better movies at youtube.  
Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  
The live music on Fridays totally blows.
The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.
None of them are engaging or exciting.  
Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.
very tough and very short on flavor!
Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!
Must have been an off night at this place.
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.

This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.
I probably won't be back, to be honest.
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  
None of them are engaging or exciting.  
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  
I have had this phone for over a year now, and I will tell you, its not that great.
I'm super pissd.
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.
The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.
This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  
poor voice clarity.
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.

I was not impressed by this product.
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.
The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!
Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.
Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.
I'm super pissd.
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.
The burger... I got the "Gold Standard" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.
If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)
Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.
